# ADR 0002: stock_balances maintained by the application layer, not a DB trigger

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-09-02

## Context

`docs/architecture.md` §6 left this open: "`stock_balances` is a
materialized projection maintained transactionally in the same DB
transaction as the movement insert (via trigger or explicit
application-layer update inside the same transaction — decided in Stage
2 against real write-volume numbers, not guessed now)."

## Decision

**Application-layer update**, inside the same `RunScoped` transaction as
the `stock_movements` insert (`internal/modules/inventory/app.Service.recordMovement`).

## Reasoning

1. **Costing logic already lives in Go.** Weighted-average cost
   recalculation (`domain.CostingStrategy.OnReceipt`) needs the current
   balance, the movement's quantity/cost, and a formula that's naturally
   expressed as Go arithmetic on `decimal.Decimal`. Re-deriving the same
   formula in PL/pgSQL would mean maintaining the costing rule twice, in
   two languages, with no shared test coverage between them — a real risk
   for a number that ends up in stock valuation reports.
2. **Locking is already explicit and correct without a trigger.**
   `recordMovement` takes the balance row lock via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`
   (`StockBalanceRepository.GetForUpdate`) before computing the new value,
   which is exactly the serialization a trigger would otherwise need to
   provide implicitly. A trigger doesn't buy additional correctness here.
3. **Consistency with this codebase's existing pattern.** Every other
   "derive B from A inside the same transaction" case so far (audit log
   entries, session rotation) is application-layer code, not a trigger —
   keeping stock balance maintenance in the same place keeps the mental
   model of "where does side-effect X happen" consistent across modules.
   The one place this codebase *does* use a DB-level mechanism for a
   write-time invariant is RLS policies (a security boundary, not a
   derived-value calculation) — a different category of concern.
4. **Debuggability.** A stack trace and a `slog` call site in Go is easier
   to reason about during an incident than a trigger silently firing
   underneath an `INSERT`. Given `stock_balances` directly drives sale
   eligibility (can this order be fulfilled?) and valuation reporting,
   an engineer diagnosing a discrepancy benefits from the update being a
   readable, steppable function rather than implicit database behavior.

## Consequences

- Every code path that writes a `stock_movements` row **must** go through
  `Service.recordMovement` (directly, or via `RecordMovementForOtherModule`
  for a cross-module caller like `purchases.FinalizeDocument`) — there is
  no database-level backstop that keeps `stock_balances` in sync if a
  future migration or admin script inserts into `stock_movements`
  directly. This is a real risk to document, not hand-wave away: a raw
  `INSERT INTO stock_movements` bypassing the application layer would
  silently desynchronize the materialized balance from the ledger.
- Mitigated by: (a) `stock_balances` is explicitly documented as
  "always re-derivable from `stock_movements` by replaying it" — the
  backup/restore reconciliation check (Scenario N, Stage 11) is exactly
  the safety net for this failure mode, and (b) no application code or
  migration in this repository writes to `stock_movements` any way other
  than through `recordMovement`.
- If a future measured write-volume problem shows this application-layer
  path is a throughput bottleneck (unlikely at the scale this system
  targets — a single warehouse's movement rate, not a high-frequency
  trading ledger), moving the balance-maintenance arithmetic into a
  trigger remains possible without changing the `stock_movements` schema;
  only `internal/modules/inventory/app.Service.recordMovement`'s internals
  would need to change.
